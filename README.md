# Hedgehog

In an AI-driven world, algorithms and data structures remain critical for optimizing, debugging, and understanding systems at a deeper level. While AI tools can automate many aspects of coding, they cannot replace the fundamental knowledge required to create, understand, and refine complex software solutions effectively.

### Hedgehog features

Hedgehog is a user-friendly tool designed to help users tackle challenges and track their progress. It offers a clean interface and efficient features to streamline solving challenges.
Key features of Hedgehog include:

- A timer to keep users focused and engaged.
- The ability to pause and resume the timer, automatically restarting when the user begins editing again, ensuring flexibility during interrupted sessions.
- Language options, currently supporting C++ and Golang, with potential for easy expansion to more languages.
- Light and dark themes to reduce eye strain and enhance comfort.
- A solution display with a toggle to switch between the user's submitted code and the expected solution.
- The ability to skip a question and proceed to the next one.
- An option to retry the same question, encouraging continued learning and improvement.

# How to build and execute Hedgehog

You will need Qt installation to build Hedgehog, after what you can do
